    The surprising complexity of music.
---


I started learning guitar as an adult with no musical backround a few years ago.
For me, guitar is a way to relax.
I don't need or want to spend hours locked in a room practicing.

One of the things that I am consistenly drawn to is maths.
Maths is a language that helps us to describe the world.
I think I like it because I like understanding the relationships between things.
Maths describes those relationships.

With any skill, there is an initial period where effort is low and the reward is high.
After that, another period follows where effort is high but the reward is low.
Seth Godin dicusses this in his book [The Dip](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/324748.The_Dip?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=QfoIohQtaO&rank=1).
After the dip, the reward increases exponentially with effort.

It feels like my guitar playing is starting to come out of the dip.
The transition has piqued a sudden interest in music theory.
It is the meeting point of my love for maths and a developing proficiency in music.

# Maths and Guitar
Music is filled with mathematical relationships.
It's also filled with confusing terms.

Most music theory books outline the important terms and concepts but don't give any information about where those things originate from.
After reading some articles on music theory, and even buying an often [recommended book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/212353.Music_Theory_for_Guitarists_Book_Online_Audio?ref=nav_sb_ss_2_27), I have been left unsatisfied with even the basic ideas of music.
I have questions.
Lots of them!

Why twelve notes?
Where does the major scale come from?
Why is an interval major, minor, diminished, augmented or perfect?
Why do we use A = 440Hz?
Why are some notes accidental?

If you look these things up online, you'll find a mess of information.
Many of throw out a whole host of confusing terms that don't actually explain anything.

This is because the answers to theses questions are obfuscated by personal preference, history and a whole lot of maths.

# The Fundamentals
The roots of all music stem from three concepts.

* A doubling of the note frequency sounds the same
* Humans like hearing notes whose frequencies are simple ratios
* Music is defined by a pattern of note intervals

These aren't hard and fast rules, but they do apply generally.

To understand why, let's go back to the beginning and look at the physics of sound.

# What is a Note?
A note is a vibration that has a single frequency.
