     How I designed and built my own keyboard; and why it only has 34 keys!
---

I'm typing this post using a 34 key keyboard that I designed and built from scratch.
Everything is custom, from the key positions, to the case, right through to the keymap.

If you'd like an overview of the project, check out it's GitHub repository.

This is the first in a series of posts that will walk through the design process, culminating in the final build and my thoughts on using the keyboard as a daily driver.
In this post, we'll look at the high level idea, and define the key positions.

But first, how did I get here?


# Deciding to Build a Keyboard
Shoes. Yes. Shoes.

That's how I ended up building my own keyboard.
Specifically, barefoot shoes.
If you've never been into the world of barefoot shoes, you may be thinking, "How can there be such a thing as a barefoot shoe?".
It's a reasonable thing to think, and part of the reason I was interested in them.

This isn't about barefoot shoes, but if you'd like to know more, there are plenty of articles and videos about the topic.
I've particuarly enjoyed the [Barefoot Strength](https://www.youtube.com/@barefootstrength) YouTube channel, and I can recommend reading [Born to Run](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6289283-born-to-run?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=KUJgmqtudr&rank=1) by Christopher McDougall.

I was, however, led from barefoot shoes to keyboards by a one video from [Ben Vallack](https://www.youtube.com/@BenVallack).
Ben's channel is varied, but there was a point where he spent a great deal of time building and experimenting with keyboards.
He was interested in using as few keys as possible, eventually settling (if I remember correctly), on an 18 key layout on which he could type at 80 words per minute.
