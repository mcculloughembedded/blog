I am an embedded firmware developer working with memory constrained devices in the consumer electronics industry.
In my day to day work I use C++ for on-chip development and Python for off-chip testing and debugging.

Outside of work I play guitar, am interested in custom mechanical keyboards and try to expand my embedded skillset.
I have a passion for learning and believe growth is achieved when one either learns new skills or improves ones current skills.

I love to read both fiction and non-fiction and I try to keep physically active; although it's not always easy!
I have been watching Formula 1 since I was 9 years old.
Despite being brought up around vintage cars and motor racing, I have always been inclined towards computers and technology.
