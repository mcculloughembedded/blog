I am an embedded firmware developer with experience working with memory constrained devices in the consumer electronics industry.
I primarily use C/C++ for on-chip development and Python for off-chip testing and debugging.
I am currently on a sabbatical.
You can read about my goals for this period in this post.

I play guitar, am interested in custom mechanical keyboards and I am always trying to expand my embedded skill set.
I have a passion for learning and believe growth is achieved when one either learns new skills or improves ones current skills.

I love to read both fiction and non-fiction.
I am usually reading one fiction and one non-fiction book simultaneously.
I try to keep physically active - although it's not always easy!
I have been watching Formula 1 since I was 9 years old.
Despite being brought up around vintage cars and motor racing, I have always been inclined towards computers and technology.
